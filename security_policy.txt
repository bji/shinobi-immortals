The Shinobi Immortals program is non-upgradeable, open source, and instructions are provided for verifying that
the provided source is exactly that which built the program.  See README.md.

Therefore, any user can audit the program, or have the program audited on their behalf, and can and should only
use the program after performing such an audit or having such an audit performed on their behalf.

There are no warranties, implied or otherwise, for the use of this program.  All users use it at their own risk,
that risk being calculable because all end users have access to the source and can determine what degree of risk
the program represents to them.

If any bugs, or suspected bugs, are discovered, please send a report to shinobisystems@yahoo.com.  Although the
program cannot be upgraded, it would be possible to discontinue use of it and switch to a new program that has
a fix for the bug.
